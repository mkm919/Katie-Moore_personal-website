<h2> About Me</h2>
<p> My name is <b> Katie Moore </b> and I am in school to be a <I> Library Media Specialist </I>.  I love to read, travel and hang out with friends and family.  I enjoy reading all kinds of books but I generally enjoy reading fantasy and romance.  Some of my favorite authors are <em> Colleen Hoover </em> and <em>Sarah J. Maas </em>.  I like to travel on mission trips and for fun.  Some of my favorite vacations combine two things I enjoy: <br>
1. <strong> History </strong> - I am trying to visit every state, as well as all the <a href="https://www.archives.gov/presidential-libraries" </a> Presidential Libraries </a> <br>
2. <strong> Wine </strong>- I keep track of the wines I taste on an app in my phone <br> <br>
I mostly go on these vacations with my mom.  I have been to 9 Presidential Libraries and have 4 left.  Former President Obama and Trump have not opened yet.  We enjoy learning about history together and both enjoy learning and trying new wines.  
<h2> Teaching Background </h2>
</p> I am finishing up my <b> 14th year </b> of teaching tomorrow.  I have taught 3 years in fifth grade and the rest in fourth grade.  I went into teaching because I felt called to do so and couldn't imagine doing anything else.  I have hundreds of books in my classroom library and have cataloged them using <a href="https://www.booksource.com/" </a> <b> Book Source </b> </a>so I can check books in and out for students.  I love to foster the love of reading in my students so I try to have a large variety of books available for them to try.  This love of reading and technology spurred me into getting a Library Media Specialist degree.
